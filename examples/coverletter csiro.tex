\begin{cvletter}

I really appreciate the valuable opportunity of applying for the Data Scientist role, which I came across on the Seek website. After reading the job description, I considered myself highly suitable for the program, with the desirable skill set to meet performance expectations.

\lettersection{About Me}

I believe very strongly in what I can deliver. I have just graduated with Honours in March from the Australian National University, with a double degree in Advanced Computing (Honours) and Science. In it, I specialised in Intelligent Systems and Advanced Mathematics. I would confidently say that I am a competent and quality-orientated person and a great problem solver from my studies. In addition, I have developed an excellent understanding of a wide range of programming languages and tools among my skills. My Honours project is about Heuristics for Probabilistic Planning. I have solid knowledge about developing some new algorithms and also testing them. I received a High Distinction for my honours project.


I was an Academic Tutor at the Australian National University tutoring Advanced Computing R\&D Method. Among my tutoring experiences, I am consistently recognised as a supportive person. I have always listened to my students' needs and guided them to fulfil learning outcomes. More importantly, I learned to tailor answers for people from different cultural and knowledge backgrounds. I have good demonstration skills. My reviewers see me as a good presenter. They think my presentations are concise and easy to understand. I love to share my findings and knowledge with other tutors while learning from them. I maintained good communication and cooperation with the course convenor and other tutors. I have been a teaching assistant in scuba diving, which my students always enjoy my humour and reliability.

I have solid data analysis skills. I developed the data analysis software to analyse and create standard graphics for paleoecology research with Dr Rebecca from the College of Asia and the Pacific. My software helped boost research efficiency significantly. Also, I am the tech lead of the group. So I am not just doing a data analysis job but also developed decent leadership skills.

I have competent research skills. Among my study experiences and especially my Honours year, I have developed excellent research skills. I read and learn from significant amount papers individually so that I can complete the tasks. This can be beneficial to my works since we need to work in a team, but we also need to research and solve the allocated tasks along.

I love to learn new skills. I am currently learning Microsoft AI Engineer Certificate simultaneously, and I will take the exam in November. So I have a high possibility of being qualified before the program starts. I am also currently in the Professional Year program, which allows me to learn decent working skills and fit into Australian working culture.

I am applying not only because I am capable of the job but also because I appreciate the learning opportunities CSIRO offers. I am fascinated about working with top scientists at one of the best research institutions in the world. I have worked with CSIRO staff once, while I proposed my computer vision project to Ms Nicole Fisher at the Digitisation Department. She was very interested in the project, however, due to availabilities of contracts, the project did not proceed. But this has given me the first experience of this research institution. My passion about data work is also one of the reasons I am applying today.

I am passionate about life. You can find me completed barista courses, scuba courses, boat driving courses. I have a photography studio, which I take photos for real estate. I take my Sundays to help services at Life Unlimited Church. I always believe that only if I am passionate about life, then I can bring others happiness.

Upon appraising my resume, I hope you find me a competent candidate with the right personality for the job. I believe myself to be conscientious, tenacious and passionate, and I create high value for your group.

Thank you for taking the time to review my materials. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything else you might need. I look forward to hearing from you soon.


\lettersection{Selection Criteria Responses}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I have obtained my double bachelor's degrees with honours in advanced computing and science, which my research fields are artificial intelligence planning and numerical analysis.
	\item I have a Hong Kong license at the moment, which is equivalent to a full license here. But I can exchange to an Australian one any time.
	\item I have worked on multiple python based data projects, including recognition, NLP, CV. The datasets were various, including image, text, numerical data. Heterogeneous data is similar.
	\item I have basic knowledge of GIS and sensing data. However, I am a fast learner. When I did the paleoecology project and the digitisation project, I could quickly catch up with related research knowledge.
	\item I have solid data collecting, cleaning, processing and analysis skills, which those steps included in most of my projects before. I also have a solid understanding of statistical analysis and machine learning methods. I also have a solid background in AI areas, especially planning, my honours project, and I received a High Distinction for my thesis.
	\item I have worked with different research groups. They always see me as a good teammate that adapts to a new environment fast. Moreover, I am very motivated, which is why I succeeded in my Honours research that I have to carry out all works myself. 
\end{itemize}

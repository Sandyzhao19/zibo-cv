\begin{cvletter}

I really appreciate the valuable opportunity of applying for the Graduate Software Engineers, which I came across on the Seek website. After reading the job description, I considered myself highly suitable for the program, with the desirable skill set to meet performance expectations.

\lettersection{About Me}

I believe very strongly in what I can deliver. I have just graduated with Honours in March from the Australian National University, with a double degree in Advanced Computing (Honours) and Science. In it, I specialised in Intelligent Systems and Advanced Mathematics. I would confidently say that I am a competent and quality-orientated person and a great problem solver from my studies. In addition, I have developed an excellent understanding of a wide range of programming languages and tools among my skills. My Honours project is about Heuristics for Probabilistic Planning. I have solid knowledge about developing some new algorithms and also testing them. I received a High Distinction for my honours project.


I was an Academic Tutor at the Australian National University tutoring Advanced Computing R\&D Method. Among my tutoring experiences, I am consistently recognised as a supportive person. I have always listened to my students' needs and guided them to fulfil learning outcomes. More importantly, I learned to tailor answers for people from different cultural and knowledge backgrounds. I have good demonstration skills. My reviewers see me as a good presenter. They think my presentations are concise and easy to understand. I love to share my findings and knowledge with other tutors while learning from them. I maintained good communication and cooperation with the course convenor and other tutors. I have been a teaching assistant in scuba diving, which my students always enjoy my humour and reliability.

I have solid software developing skills. During my studies, me and my team had developed a data analysis platform for paleoecologiests, also image recognition software for Questagame. Thus, I am familiar with team developing environment. Moreover, I have been using 

I have competent research skills. Among my study experiences and especially my Honours year, I have developed excellent research skills. I read and learn from significant amount papers individually so that I can complete the tasks. This can be beneficial to my works since we need to work in a team, but we also need to research and solve the allocated tasks along.

I love to learn new skills. I am currently learning CFA level 1 and Power BI simultaneously, taking the exam in November. So I have a high possibility of being qualified before the program starts. I am also currently in the Professional Year program, which allows me to learn decent working skills and fit into Australian working culture.

I am applying not only because I am capable of the job but also because I appreciate the learning opportunities Instaclustr offers.

I am passionate about life. You can find me completed barista courses, scuba courses, boat driving courses. I have a photography studio, which I take photos for real estate. I take my Sundays to help services at Life Unlimited Church. I always believe that only if I am passionate about life, then I can bring others happiness.

Upon appraising my resume, I hope you find me a competent candidate with the right personality for the job. I believe myself to be conscientious, tenacious and passionate, and I create high value for your group.

Thank you for taking the time to review my materials. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything else you might need. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

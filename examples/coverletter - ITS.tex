\begin{cvletter}

I really appreciate the valuable opportunity of applying for the Service Desk Officer role, which I came across on the ANU Jobs website. After reading the job description, I considered myself highly suitable for the posotopm, with the desirable skill set to meet performance expectations.

\lettersection{About Me}

I believe very strongly in what I can deliver. I have just graduated with Honours in March from the Australian National University, with a double degree in Advanced Computing (Honours) and Science. In it, I specialised in Intelligent Systems and Advanced Mathematics. From my studies, I would confidently say that I am a competent and quality-orientated person and a great problem solver. I have developed an excellent understanding of a wide range of programming languages and tools among my skills.

Among all directions in the Digital Customer Platforms, I am interested in Customer Transformation more. Not only I had been working using Salesforce when I did my internship in HPE, I always see how the digital technologies can benefit all tasks. This is what I am passionate about. I could not be happier every time I improved their workflow and see their happy faces.

I was an Academic Tutor at the Australian National University tutoring Advanced Computing R\&D Method. Among my tutoring experiences, I am consistently recognised as a supportive person. I have always listened to my students' needs and guided them to fulfil learning outcomes. More importantly, I learned to tailor answers for people from different cultural and knowledge backgrounds. I have good demonstration skills. My reviewers see me as a good presenter. They think my presentations concise and easy to understand. I love to share my findings and knowledge with other tutors while learning from them. I maintained good communication and cooperation with the course convenor and other tutors. I have been a teaching assistant in scuba diving, which my students always enjoy my humour and reliability.

I have solid data analysis skills. I developed the data analysis software to analyse and create research standard graphics for paleoecology research with Dr Rebecca from the College of Asia and the Pacific. My software helped boost research efficiency significantly. Also, I am the tech lead of the group. So I am not just doing a data analysis job but also developed decent leadership skills.

I have competent research skills. Among my study experiences and especially my Honours year, I have developed excellent research skills. I read and learn from significant amount papers individually so that I can complete the tasks. This can be beneficial to my works since we need to work in a team, but we also need to be able to research and solve the allocated tasks along.

I love to learn new skills. I am currently learning CFA level 1 and Power BI simultaneously, which I am taking the exam in November. So I have a high possibility of being qualified before the program starts. I am also currently in the Professional Year program, which allows me to learn decent working skills and fit to Australian working culture.

I am applying not only because I am capable of the job but also it is a good point to start to build my professional skills within a good team. 

I am passionate about life. You can find me completed barista courses, scuba courses, boat driving courses. I have a photography studio, which I take photos for real estates. I take my Sundays to help services at Life Unlimited Church. I always believe that only if I am passionate about life, then I can bring others happiness.

Upon appraising my resume, I hope you find me to be a competent candidate with the right personality for the job. I believe myself to be conscientious, tenacious and passionate, and I create high value for your group.

Thank you for taking the time to review my materials. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything else you might need. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
